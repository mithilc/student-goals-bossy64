Goal 1: Get an A and a 5 on the AP test by coming to tutorials if I need help and doing all the readings on time

Rubric:
- 4: Accomplish both the “A” and the “5”
- 3: Only get an “A” and not the “5” (and vice versa) because I didn’t do one of the listed things
- 2: Get neither but still do some of the listed things
- 1: Get neither and don’t do any of the listed things.
